### Quiz01
in the first quiz, I'm working on developers survey data from StackOverflow,
you can find the .zip file in the directory as well, in the jupiter notebook you'll find

- different ways to read data from dataframe
- select specific rows and columns from df
- set desired columns as an index (in my case I am using **ResponseId**)
- create filters and select data using those filters
    1. we can find developers from India or USA who have worked with Python
- sorting values in a df using one or multiple columns
    1. in this case, we are using Age and yearly salary
- do statistical analysis on the data
    1. calculate avg yearly salary of USA developers
  2. calcualte standard deviation, least and most work experience in years of Swiss developers
- create graphs, three graphs you will find in my program are:
  1. developers average salary by their age
  2. georgian developers and their average salary based on their experience
  3. heatmap of every programming language ever used by the developers in total
